Filters content blocks out of messages before extraction.

Blocks whose kind is in [exclude](#exclude) are stripped; a message left with no content is dropped entirely. Defaults to excluding tool traffic (`toolUse` / `toolResult`), which is rarely useful as long-term memory and adds noise.

## Properties

```ts
